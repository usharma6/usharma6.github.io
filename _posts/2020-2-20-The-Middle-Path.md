title: The Middle Path
---

The sense of the Middle is an important and ancient idea. Aristotle described it as the Golden Mean. In Buddhism, the eightfold path is described as the middle path. The Yin Yang is a memorable symbol of balance. The world tells us that we must be balance. But there are also so many ways to balance. Look at nature, there are animals which have a sense of balance that are completely and utterly uneven. Think of a rock tower that is extremely beautiful. It is balanced, but not at all uniform. We must embrace our imbalances, these are our natural gifts. As we work on them, and grow with them, that is how we can come into true balance and achieve true greatness. That is a livelihood worth writing about, a history worth learning from. That is what I believe nirvana is, what I believe heaven is, what i believe greatness is, and that is how I will strive to live my life.
